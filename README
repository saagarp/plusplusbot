plusplusbot is an IRC karmabot that I wrote and maintain primarily for entertainment value. The bot has no real-world application, the database format really could use some work, and most of the updates nowadays are to prevent the bot spamming too much in an actual channel.

It's built on top of pircbot, the first IRC bot library I found for a language I'm familiar with.
